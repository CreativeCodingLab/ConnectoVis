ConnectoVis is a novel software tool that facilitates the interactive exploration and comparative analysis of multiple dynamic brain networks.

### Upload Custom Data 
- You can upload your custom data folder under the connectome data pathway: ConnectoVis/Assets/Resources/Data 
- Folder structure of connectome data is shown in images below
- Folder names and file names are case sensitive 
- Note that each csv file need to have a header 
- Edge connectivity data and topology data should be normalized to (-1, 1) (Both positive and negative connectivities can be shown on ConnectoVis)
